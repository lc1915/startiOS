## Swift
### Basic types

```
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50
let myConstant = 42
```

**type inference:**

Every constant and variable in Swift has a type, but you don’t always have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type. In the example above, the compiler infers that myVariable is an integer because its initial value is an integer. This is called type inference.
